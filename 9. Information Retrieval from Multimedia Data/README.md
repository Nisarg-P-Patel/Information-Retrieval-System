# Information Retrieval from Multimedia Data: Food Classification

## Aim
The aim of this project is to implement information retrieval techniques on multimedia data, specifically for classifying food images. The project utilizes deep learning algorithms to classify images into various food categories.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classify food images into categories such as healthy, junk, dessert, appetizer, mains, soups, carbs, protein, fats, and meat.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize images and prepare them for training using the Xception model.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Leverage transfer learning with the Xception model for effective image classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Visualize training and validation loss to assess model performance.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to upload images for classification and display the predicted categories.

## Packages Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy opencv-python keras matplotlib
