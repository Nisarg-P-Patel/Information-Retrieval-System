# Exploring Virtual Labs for Advanced Experiments

## Aim
The purpose of this project is to explore the calculations of bigram probabilities in text documents using TF-IDF vectorization. This analysis includes both smoothed and unsmoothed probability calculations to understand the effect of smoothing on bigram probabilities.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Implement techniques such as lowercasing, tokenization, and stemming to prepare text data.
- **Bigram Probability Calculation**: Calculate probabilities of bigram sequences in a given document.
- **Smoothing Techniques**: Compare bigram probabilities with and without smoothing to analyze their impact on the model.

## Packages Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and display.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stemming.
- **Scikit-learn**: For TF-IDF vectorization.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn
