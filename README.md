   - **Key Features**: Word counting, unique word frequency analysis, visualization of word frequencies.

2. **Text Processing and Clustering Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Perform text preprocessing and clustering analysis on documents using K-Means clustering.
   - **Key Features**: Text tokenization, stop word removal, TF-IDF vectorization, hierarchical clustering visualization.

3. **Mini Search Engine**
   - **Objective**: Create a mini search engine that recommends similar plays based on user input.
   - **Key Features**: TF-IDF vectors, cosine similarity calculations, and search functionality for document retrieval.

4. **Document Clustering using K-Means**
   - **Objective**: Implement K-Means clustering on document data and visualize clustering results.
   - **Key Features**: Elbow method for optimal cluster determination, clustering visualization with dendrograms.

5. **Text Classification using Naive Bayes**
   - **Objective**: Classify text messages as spam or non-spam using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
   - **Key Features**: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, model evaluation using classification metrics.

6. **Dimensionality Reduction using SVD**
   - **Objective**: Use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction on text data.
   - **Key Features**: TF-IDF vectorization, SVD implementation, analysis of concept space.

7. **Meta Search Techniques Implementation**
   - **Objective**: Implement various meta search techniques to aggregate rankings from multiple evaluators.
   - **Key Features**: Borda count, Condorcet method, reciprocal ranking for final ranking determination.

8. **Information Retrieval from Multimedia Data**
   - **Objective**: Classify food images using deep learning techniques and retrieve information from images.
